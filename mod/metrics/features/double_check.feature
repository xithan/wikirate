Feature: Double check
  As signed in user I can double check and request checks for metric values

  Scenario: Can't check if not signed in
    When I go to card "Jedi+disturbances in the Force+Death Star+2000"
    # And I hover over "Double check"
    And I click on "Yes, I checked"
    And I wait for ajax response
    Then I should see "please sign in"

  Scenario: Check and undo
    When I am signed in as Joe User
    And I go to card "Jedi+disturbances in the Force+Death Star+2000"
    # Then I should see "Double check"
    # When I hover over "Double check"
    # And I click on "Yes, I checked the value"
    And I click on "Yes, I checked"
    # FIXME: It used to work with a single click
        #   but at some point I had to introduce a second
        #   click to click the button once.
    Then I should see "Yes, I checked the value"

    When I am signed in as Joe Admin
