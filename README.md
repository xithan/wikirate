Wagn application code used at Wikirate.org
=========

Steps to make it work
----

1. create folders "files","config","public" and "public/assets" under the wikirate root directory.
2. rake wagn:seed
3. import the database
4. bundle exec wagn s


Testing
=========

Paths:
```sh
 mod/*/spec                       # rspec tests
 mod/*/features                   # cucumber tests
 mod/*/features/step_definitions  # cucumber step definitions
```

Run `rake wikirate:test:reseed_data` to prepare test database.
1. This command accepts one argument that indicate the production DB env. `production`, `local`, `dev` are options to set the location of your seed DB. Options other than these three will be treated as `production`.
2. It will get the pre-defined seed cards from the card `production_export` and then import some needed cards from `test/seed.rb`. Migration will also be run to let the test db catch up to your local dev environment. 
3. It will dump the test db to `test/wikiratetest.db` for the CI testing.


Start rspec with `wagn rspec` and cucumber with `wagn cucumber`.
Alternatively, you can use the shorter commands `wagn rs` and `wagn cc`
