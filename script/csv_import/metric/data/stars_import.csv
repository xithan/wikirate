"Sustainability Tracking, Assessment & Rating System (STARS)",Electricity from Geothermal (%),What pecentage (%) electricity used by the institution is generated from geothermal?,"For most institutions, energy consumption is the largest source of greenhouse gas emissions, which cause global climate change. Global climate change is having myriad negative impacts throughout the world, including increased frequency and potency of extreme weather events, sea level rise, species extinction, water shortages, declining agricultural production, ocean acidification, and spread of diseases. The impacts are particularly pronounced for vulnerable and poor communities and countries. In addition to causing global climate change, energy generation from fossil fuels, especially coal, produces air pollutants such as sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, mercury, dioxins, arsenic, cadmium and lead. These pollutants contribute to acid rain as well as health problems such as heart and respiratory diseases and cancer. Coal mining and oil and gas drilling can also damage environmentally and/or culturally significant ecosystems. Nuclear power creates highly toxic and long-lasting radioactive waste. Large-scale hydropower projects flood habitats and disrupt fish migration and can involve the relocation of entire communities.

Implementing conservation measures and switching to renewable sources of energy can help institutions save money and protect them from utility rate volatility. Renewable energy may be generated locally and allow campuses to support local economic development. Furthermore, institutions can help shape markets by creating demand for cleaner, renewable sources of energy.","Timeframe

Sampling and Data Standards
Report all on-site, stationary energy that was consumed by the institution (as the institution is defined in the overall STARS institutional boundary). Transportation fuels are excluded. Reporting on a sample or subset of energy generation and consumption is not allowed for this credit.

All reported energy figures should be based on site energy (the amount of energy consumed on campus) rather than source energy (the amount of energy consumed on campus plus the energy used off-site to generate and transport the energy to the institution).

Institutions that convert fuel on-site (e.g., on-campus cogeneration facilities and boilers) should report only the amount of fuel purchased/converted toward the total energy consumption figure, not the resulting heat, steam, hot/chilled water or electricity.

To aggregate energy consumption data from multiple sources, figures should be converted into MMBtu (one million British thermal units—a standard measure of energy) using the following equivalents:

Institution-catalyzed carbon offsets are generated by what are commonly referred to as “local offsets” programs. In such programs, institutions offset their greenhouse gas emissions by implementing projects that reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the local community. For example, a local offsets program may engage students in weatherizing homes in the surrounding community. As part of the arrangement with the homeowner, the institution would “own” the emissions reductions that result from the program. Local projects that are to be used as offsets must be third party verified or, at minimum, quantified using a method that is consistent with the World Resources Institute’s [[http://www.ghgprotocol.org/standards/project-protocol|GHG Protocol for Project Accounting]].

Institutions may choose the start and end dates that work best with the data they have (e.g., fiscal or calendar year), as long as data are reported from a consecutive 12-month (or 3-year) period.

Sampling and Data Standards
Institution-catalyzed offsets that are to be counted as offsets must be third party verified or, at minimum, quantified using a method that addresses all of the following accounting issues:
- Selection of a baseline scenario (i.e, what would have happened in the absence of the project?);
- Demonstration of additionality (i.e., the project has resulted in emission reductions or removals in addition to what would have happened in the absence of the project);
- Identification and quantification of relevant secondary effects (i.e., small, unintended GHG consequences of a project, include leakage and changes in GHG emissions up- and downstream of the project);
- Consideration of reversibility (i.e., assessing the risk of reversibility, together with any mitigation or compensation measures included in the project design);
- Avoidance of double-counting (i.e., the reductions giving rise to the offset must occur at sources or sinks not included in the target or cap for which the offset is used).

To account for Institution-catalyzed offsets institutions may pursue third party verification or else use a credible methodology that addresses all of the accounting issues outlined in B. Criteria. 
Examples include:
- GHG Protocol for Project Accounting (World Resources Institute)
- Land Use, Land Change and Forestry (IPCC)
- Forest Project Protocol (Climate Action Reserve),
- Framework for Forest Management Offset Protocols (Canadian Council of Forest Ministers)
- The Compliance Offset Protocols (COP) adopted by the California Air Resources Board (CARB).
